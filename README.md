Key Components:
	OTA Management System (Backend System):
	Profile Repository: Stores SIM/USIM profile data (e.g., keys, parameters, configuration files).
	Update Engine: Prepares and securely packages profile updates (using TLV or a proprietary format) following standards (e.g., 3GPP TS 31.102, GSM 11.14).
	Security Module: Handles encryption, authentication, and integrity checks for the OTA messages (ensuring the update file complies with the operator’s security policy).
	OTA Server:Receive request from OTA management converting the profile update into a properly formatted SMS-PP message, and interfacing with the SMS infrastructure.Implements secure messaging (e.g., using mechanisms defined in 3GPP TS 11.14 for SIM OTA).

Standards and References
	•	GSM 11.14 / 3GPP TS 31.102:Specifies the structure and management of SIM/USIM applications, including OTA update procedures.
	•	ISO/IEC 7816-4:Defines file structures and TLV encoding for smart cards.
	•	ETSI TS 102 221:Provides additional guidelines on SIM card management and secure messaging.
	•	3GPP TS 23.102 & TS 23.501:These documents outline network and security requirements for 5G systems, where OTA 
 provisioning plays a role in SIM personalization and key updates.
